## Description

* This project was created as platform where workers and employers could cooperate and share informations in one place and effectively. It was supposed to minimize office space needed for workers. It was supposed to include room-reservation, calendars for individuals, to-do list for projects, list of upcoming events and reward system supposed to remove need of individuals to work out of their working hours. 

After 10 days it became clear that we would not be able to complete this project in time specified even though we spend a lot of our free time on this project. We have realized that it was no longer fun for us. We struggled to make any progress on the project because we were no longer encouraged. At least we tried.

From this point on we will no longer actively participate in the competition. We might try out chances from time to time if we will like the challenge. We learned a lot of new things during this competition, but we figured out that for the time being it is more worth for us sticking up to our own projects and passions. 

We are still grateful for the ability to compete and try something new. We will for sure try our luck next time with at least one more team member. 

Sincerely Peter and Martin. *
